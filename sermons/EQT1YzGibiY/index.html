The message celebrates River Valley Church's 30th anniversary and introduces a new core group called &#34;The Commission&#34; focused on discipleship and reaching neighbors with a biblical worldview. The sermon emphasizes that the Good Samaritan story is not merely about random acts of kindness but about showing mercy across enemy lines—loving those who are culturally, religiously, or socially opposed to you.

The historical context reveals the deep-seated hatred between Jews and Samaritans, dating back centuries to when the northern kingdom intermarried with Assyrians and was considered polluted by the southern kingdom. Pastor Rob draws parallels to modern conflicts like the Rwanda genocide and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict to help congregants understand the magnitude of what Jesus was teaching. The story shows that a Jewish man in need was passed by a priest and Levite (religious leaders) but was helped by a Samaritan—his enemy—who showed extraordinary compassion and generosity.

The message challenges believers to examine their excuses for not showing mercy and to practice love without limits. Jesus calls His followers to love not just the &#34;nice and near&#34; but also the &#34;naughty&#34;—those who are difficult, different, or even hostile. Pastor Rob shares personal testimony about forgiving neighbors who opposed his property plans and choosing to love them anyway. The sermon concludes with a call to live out the gospel in our own neighborhoods before attempting to share it globally, demonstrating God's love to all people regardless of their relationship to us."><!-- Open Graph / Facebook --><meta property="og:type" content="website"><meta property="og:url" content="https://eternityalive.com/sermons/EQT1YzGibiY/"><meta property="og:title" content="The Good Samaritan - Love Your Neighbor - Pastor Rob Ketterling"><meta property="og:description" content="Pastor Rob Ketterling kicks off a three-part series called &#34;Love Your Neighbor&#34; with the parable of the Good Samaritan from Luke 10.
