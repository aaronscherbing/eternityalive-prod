Throughout the epistle, John has emphasized three recurring themes: faith, love, and obedience. In this final chapter, John brings everything to a climax by declaring that believers have victory over sin, the world, and the devil through Jesus Christ. The message addresses the spiritual battle that Christians face in a world system that opposes God and constantly tries to conform believers to its patterns.

The sermon emphasizes that God's commandments are not burdensome because Jesus is present with believers, giving them the strength to obey. Pastor Rob challenges the notion—promoted by both the world and some preachers—that God's commands are restrictive or joy-killing. He shares personal stories, including visiting a high-profile church where the pastor apologized for God's purity standards, and meeting a rabbi in Jerusalem who delighted in following 613 laws. These experiences reinforced his determination to love obeying God's Word even more passionately than those under the Old Covenant.

The victory believers possess is not something they must fight to achieve but something they fight from—it's already won through Christ. Christians are not victims but victors who overcome the world through faith in Jesus as the Son of God. Pastor Rob encourages the congregation to stop letting the world squeeze the life out of them and to start living as overcomers. The message concludes with a call to realize that even when circumstances look like 'Friday,' Sunday is coming—believers are on the winning side and need to live in that victory now."><!-- Open Graph / Facebook --><meta property="og:type" content="website"><meta property="og:url" content="https://eternityalive.com/sermons/FVRI_nr9TeU/"><meta property="og:title" content="We Have the Victory"><meta property="og:description" content="Pastor Rob Ketterling concludes the study of 1 John with chapter 5, focusing on the theme of victory.
