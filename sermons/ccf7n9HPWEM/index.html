Using the metaphor of the prodigal son's return, he explores what happens after the celebration—when the father sits down with his son to establish ground rules for living in the father's house. The message challenges believers to not treat sin casually just because they are covered by grace, but to actively pursue holiness and Christlikeness.

Pastor Kirk draws a striking parallel between cancer and sin, emphasizing that just as no one would ignore a cancer diagnosis and say 'I'll be healed in heaven,' believers shouldn't ignore sin in their lives. The message is not about legalism or perfection, but about perspective, character, and integrity. It's about recognizing that what our lives produce reveals whose children we are. The core challenge is to purify ourselves as Jesus is pure, to eradicate sin from our lives with the same urgency we would fight a deadly disease, and to walk daily in the transforming power of the Holy Spirit toward becoming more like Christ."><!-- Open Graph / Facebook --><meta property="og:type" content="website"><meta property="og:url" content="https://eternityalive.com/sermons/ccf7n9HPWEM/"><meta property="og:title" content="After the Prodigal's Party"><meta property="og:description" content="In this powerful message from 1 John chapter 3, Pastor Kirk Graham addresses the critical importance of understanding our identity as children of God and the incompatibility of sin in a believer's life.

The reason why the world does not know us is that it did not know him. Beloved, we are God&#39;s children now, and what we will be has not yet appeared; but we know that when he appears we shall be like him, because we shall see him as he is. And everyone who thus hopes in him purifies himself as he is pure. Everyone who makes a practice of sinning also practices lawlessness; sin is lawlessness. You know that he appeared in order to take away sins, and in him there is no sin. No one who abides in him keeps on sinning; no one who keeps on sinning has either seen him or known him. Little children, let no one deceive you. Whoever practices righteousness is righteous, as he is righteous. Whoever makes a practice of sinning is of the devil, for the devil has been sinning from the beginning. The reason the Son of God appeared was to destroy the works of the devil. No one born of God makes a practice of sinning, for God&#39;s seed abides in him, and he cannot keep on sinning because he has been born of God. By this it is evident who are the children of God, and who are the children of the devil: whoever does not practice righteousness is not of God, nor is the one who does not love his brother.</div> </div><div class="scripture-item" data-astro-cid-unzdbswu> <div class="scripture-reference" data-astro-cid-unzdbswu>2 Corinthians 3:18</div> <div class="scripture-text" data-astro-cid-unzdbswu>And we all, who with unveiled faces contemplate the Lord&#39;s glory, are being transformed into his image with ever-increasing glory, which comes from the Lord, who is the Spirit.</div> </div><div class="scripture-item" data-astro-cid-unzdbswu> <div class="scripture-reference" data-astro-cid-unzdbswu>James 4:8</div> <div class="scripture-text" data-astro-cid-unzdbswu>Come near to God and he will come near to you.
