He begins by reminding the congregation that believers have an advocate in Jesus Christ and that He is the propitiation for our sins - satisfying God's righteous wrath through His sacrificial death. The focus of this message is 1 John 2:15-17, which warns believers not to love the world or the things in the world, explaining that &#34;world&#34; refers to the spiritual system that exalts self, rejects God, and resists His kingdom.

Pastor Rob explains that the &#34;world&#34; is not God's creation or people, but rather a pattern of life organized around wrong principles and values that oppose God. He emphasizes that believers cannot walk with God and run with the world simultaneously - these systems are incompatible. The danger is particularly acute when Christians are not being persecuted, as there's a temptation to want to fit in and be accepted by the world's system. He encourages believers to stand firm in their convictions rather than compromise to gain acceptance from a system that fundamentally opposes Christ.

The sermon identifies three specific areas of worldly temptation from 1 John 2:16: the desires of the flesh (worldly ambitions, selfish aims, gluttony, luxury, lust), the desires of the eyes (the coveting gaze that makes us think we need what we see), and the pride of life (bragging and lying about possessions and accomplishments). Pastor Rob traces these same three temptations back to Genesis 3 with Eve's temptation. He concludes by pointing to the solution: abiding in Jesus daily through God's word, prayer, and awareness of His presence. The world is passing away, but whoever does the will of God abides forever."><!-- Open Graph / Facebook --><meta property="og:type" content="website"><meta property="og:url" content="https://eternityalive.com/sermons/kwt07vyirs4/"><meta property="og:title" content="What Are You Living For? - Pastor Rob Ketterling"><meta property="og:description" content="Pastor Rob Ketterling continues the series on 1 John, building on the previous week's message about confession and forgiveness.
