This letter from the apostle John (called 'the elder') addresses hospitality and the advancement of the gospel through four people: John himself, Gaius (a good church leader), Diotrephes (a bad church leader), and Demetrius (an itinerant minister). The central message emphasizes that disciples of Jesus are called not only to follow Christ but also to make disciples, investing spiritually into others.

Using the metaphor of 'clearing the runways,' Pastor Kirk explains that the gospel is constantly taking off and landing—prayers are sent up, missionaries are deployed, and the message of Jesus spreads. Gaius exemplified hospitality by providing a 'clear runway' for itinerant ministers to land safely and take off again, supporting them even though they were strangers. John calls Gaius a 'fellow worker' in the gospel, showing that those who support gospel workers share equally in the spiritual rewards. True hospitality is not trivial—it's the practical outworking of the command to love one another, requiring energy, time, resources, and intentionality.

In contrast, Diotrephes represents the opposite—he loved to put himself first, refused to welcome traveling ministers, and even expelled people from the church who wanted to help. His sin was pride, the same sin that led to Satan's fall. Pastor Kirk challenges believers to examine their own lives and remove any roadblocks in their personal 'runway' that hinder the advancement of the gospel. This might mean reprioritizing schedules, resources, and commitments to live hospitably and serve others. The sermon concludes with a powerful call to live 'for the sake of the Name' of Jesus Christ, believing that clearing the runway in our personal lives can change family trees for generations to come."><!-- Open Graph / Facebook --><meta property="og:type" content="website"><meta property="og:url" content="https://eternityalive.com/sermons/4RCXGQ610Ig/"><meta property="og:title" content="The Truth That Transforms"><meta property="og:description" content="Pastor Kirk Graham concludes the series on the books of 1st, 2nd, and 3rd John by teaching through the entire book of 3rd John, the shortest book in the New Testament.
