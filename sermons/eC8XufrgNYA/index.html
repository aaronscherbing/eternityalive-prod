The message emphasizes the importance of spiritual discernment in a world filled with false teachings and spiritual confusion. John, writing as a spiritual grandfather, repeatedly emphasizes that believers must test every spirit and teaching against the truth of who Jesus Christ is—fully God and fully man who came in the flesh.

The sermon focuses on three key areas believers must examine: their feed (what spiritual content they consume), their heart (their capacity to love others), and their confession (whether their words align with their character). Pastor Davey warns against spiritual influencers who sound good but twist the truth, including self-help salesmen, progressive mystics, moralistic therapeutic deists, and social gospel activists who preach justice without Jesus. True spiritual health is measured not by knowledge alone, but by love—the most concentrated use of the word &#34;love&#34; in Scripture appears in 1 John 4, with 27 mentions in one chapter.

The message concludes with a powerful reminder that God demonstrated His love first by sending Jesus as the payment for our sins. Our love for others is not optional but a vital spiritual sign that proves our relationship with God. The incarnation of Jesus Christ is the litmus test for all spiritual teaching, and our confession must be backed up by our character and actions."><!-- Open Graph / Facebook --><meta property="og:type" content="website"><meta property="og:url" content="https://eternityalive.com/sermons/eC8XufrgNYA/"><meta property="og:title" content="Check Yourself Before You Wreck Yourself"><meta property="og:description" content="Pastor Davey Collins continues the series on the Epistles of John by diving into 1 John chapter 4.
