He introduces John the Elder, believed to be John the beloved, who is writing to house churches in Ephesus. John is calling a timeout on the early church, bringing them back to the basics of faith in response to Gnostic teachings that were attacking the church. The Gnostics claimed spiritual enlightenment without submission to Jesus, saying they were above sin, which was destroying fellowship in the church.

The message focuses primarily on 1 John 1:9: &#34;If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.&#34; Pastor Rob explains that this verse should make believers run to God, not away from Him. He emphasizes the importance of walking in the light, which means living in alignment with God's nature and rejecting darkness that represents sin, falsehood, and moral distortion. Walking with God is not just following rules but building a relationship, similar to how disciples would mimic their rabbi in ancient Jewish culture.

The sermon addresses three false teachings: that you can have fellowship with God while walking in darkness, that you have no sin, and that you have not sinned. Pastor Rob breaks down 1 John 1:9 word by word, explaining that confession means acknowledging and agreeing with God about our sin, not just admitting guilt. God is faithful to His word and will forgive, and He is just because Jesus paid the price for our sins. Most importantly, God not only forgives but cleanses us from all unrighteousness, removing the guilt, stain, influence, and power of sin, and putting us on a new path with power to live righteously."><!-- Open Graph / Facebook --><meta property="og:type" content="website"><meta property="og:url" content="https://eternityalive.com/sermons/vupnibkn-fe/"><meta property="og:title" content="Walk in the Light - Pastor Rob Ketterling"><meta property="og:description" content="Pastor Rob Ketterling begins a multi-week journey through the epistles of 1 John, 2 John, and 3 John.
